usage: build_aflpp_gguf_native.sh

Builds the AFL++ replay for GGUF with the PARSER ITSELF instrumented.

This deliberately does NOT copy build_aflpp_onnx_native.sh, which links a
pre-built libonnxruntime.so: that is the reason the ONNX arm's coverage is
driver-level only (G2). Here ggml-base is compiled from the pinned source with
afl-clang-fast++ and linked statically, so afl-fuzz sees edges inside gguf.cpp.

AFL_USE_ASAN=1 matches the libFuzzer arm's sanitizer conditions. With one arm
sanitized and the other not, the two arms' finding counts cannot be compared.

Run this inside the aflplusplus/aflplusplus container; afl-clang-fast++ is not
installed on the dev machine.

  PROJECT_ROOT LLAMA_VER TARGET_DIR ARCHIVE META BUILD_ROOT PATCH SRC_CC OUT JOBS
  AFL_CC AFL_CXX CMAKE
  ALLOW_UNINSTRUMENTED=1   accept a build with no AFL++ instrumentation
  ALLOW_DRIVER_ONLY=1      accept a build whose parser is not linked in
