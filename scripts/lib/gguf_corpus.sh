# C3: which directory seeds a gguf libFuzzer run. Sourced by
# ops/scripts/fuzz-loop-libfuzzer.sh and scripts/run_long.sh so both entry points agree;
# verified by scripts/check_engine_mode_labels.sh.
#
# libFuzzer never generates an input longer than -max_len, and our loops do not set it,
# so it derives one from the corpus and never goes above 1 MB. 15 of the 19 gguf seeds
# are larger than that (1.16 MB - 10.9 MB): they are read, but no input it generates
# ever reaches their size, so the deep structure they were chosen for is never
# reproduced. scripts/build_gguf_libfuzzer_corpus.sh derives an under-cap corpus that
# keeps every metadata key.
#
# ONLY the libFuzzer arm wants this. AFL++ has no such cap, and the gguf AFL++ unit
# deliberately keeps reading seeds/gguf so its inputs stay the full-size originals - the
# two arms therefore run on deliberately different corpora, which is recorded in the
# runbook and must be stated whenever the arms are compared.
