# The TOOL_COVERAGE_GGUF_CMD target. src/coverage.rs runs this as `bash -lc` with
# OUT_DIR and CORPUS_DIR exported, and requires $OUT_DIR/coverage.json on exit 0.
#
# Replays the corpus through the source-instrumented gguf replay and emits real
# LLVM line/function coverage OF ggml/src/gguf.cpp.
#
# WHAT THIS NUMBER IS, AND IS NOT (read before quoting it anywhere):
#   * scope   : gguf.cpp only. run_coverage_onnx.sh instead measures the whole
#               libonnxruntime.so minus a regex. The two scoping rules are
#               different, so the two percentages are NOT comparable.
#   * parser  : pristine llama.cpp b7921. The clamp patch is NOT applied.
#   * depth   : GGUF_FUZZ_DEPTH (default tensor-info => no_alloc=true). At that
#               depth the tensor-data blob path is never entered by construction,
#               so those lines are permanently uncovered and stay in the
#               denominator. Raise the depth to move that boundary, do not
#               explain the number away.
#
# One process per input, on purpose: a GGML_ASSERT abort skips the atexit handler
# that writes .profraw, so batching every input into one process would let a single
# aborting seed erase the whole run's profile. Per-input isolation costs one exec
# each and loses at most that input's own counters.
