# G3: the black-box libFuzzer driver must file a library crash and only a library crash.
# `tool harness` exits 4 when the library crashed and 9 when it rejected the input before
# the library ran (missing input, precheck reject, unavailable probe) - see the exit code
# constants in src/main.rs. Aborting on 9 would record every rejected mutant as a crash
# artifact; not aborting on 4 would drop real crashes.
#
# Self-contained: compiles the driver against a test main (no libFuzzer runtime) and runs
# it against a fake `tool` whose exit code is scripted.
