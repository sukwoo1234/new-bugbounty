# Continuous ONNX libfuzzer fuzzing wrapper for 1-week systemd run on 퍼징컴.
# Decision context: results/experiments/2026-05-19-onnx-local-harness-1week-06-211-01/notes.md §"Suggested Follow-up".
#
# Difference vs ops/scripts/fuzz-loop.sh (local-harness):
#   - libfuzzer manages its own corpus + mutation internally, so no `tool mutate` step.
#   - Loop is just: `tool run --backend libfuzzer` → sleep → repeat.
#   - TOOL_LIBFUZZER_CMD env var must be set; this wrapper exports a default.
#   - Without the native ONNX driver the wrapper warns and runs the black-box tool driver
#     (libfuzzer_mode=blackbox); REQUIRE_NATIVE=1 makes that a hard failure instead.
#     Verify both paths with scripts/check_engine_mode_labels.sh.
#
# Loop: run (workers 12, timeout 30s) -> sleep 2s -> next.
# Graceful stop: SIGTERM finishes current run, then exits.
# Smoke: FUZZ_LOOP_MAX_ITERATIONS=N exits after N iterations (test only).

# the same directory as its -i set - so a libFuzzer run would both break the fixture and

# onnx is deliberately left as it was: its arms have always shared seeds/onnx by design
